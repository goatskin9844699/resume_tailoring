# Response Format Standards

## Context

- Applies to every chat interaction
- Ensures consistent and transparent communication
- Makes rule application explicit
- Added after noticing inconsistent rule application tracking

## Critical Rules

- Begin EVERY response with <APPLIED_RULES> section that:
  - Lists all relevant rule files being applied with @ prefix
  - Explains why each rule is relevant
  - Notes which rules were automatically loaded
- Follow output-format-agent.mdc standards for remaining sections
- Never skip the <APPLIED_RULES> section even for simple responses

## Examples

<example>
<APPLIED_RULES>
- @python-standards-auto.mdc (auto-loaded for .py files)
- @git-commit-agent.mdc (changes require commit)
</APPLIED_RULES>

Rest of response follows...
</example>

<example type="invalid">
Starting response without listing applied rules

Or listing rules without proper format:
- python-standards (missing .mdc and @ prefix)
- git commit rules (improper naming)
</example>
