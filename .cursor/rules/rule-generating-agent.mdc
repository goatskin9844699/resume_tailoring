# Rule Title

## Context

- When to apply this rule
- Prerequisites or conditions
- Why the rule was added or is needed

## Critical Rules

- Concise, bulleted list of actionable rules the agent MUST follow

## Examples

<example>
{valid rule application}
</example>

<example type="invalid">
{invalid rule application}
<example>
```

## Glob Pattern Examples
Common glob patterns for different rule types:
- Core standards: .cursor/rules/*.mdc
- Language rules: *.cs, *.cpp, *py

## Critical Rules
  - Rule files will be located and named ALWAYS as: `.cursor/rules/rule-name-{auto|agent|manual|always}.mdc`
  - FrontMatter Rules Types:
    - The front matter section must always start the file and include all 3 fields, even if the field value will be blank - the types are:
      - Manual Rule: IF a Manual rule is requested - description and globs MUST be blank and alwaysApply: false and filename ends with -manual.mdc.
      - Auto Rule: IF a rule is requested that should apply always to certain glob patterns (example all typescript files or all markdown files) - description must be blank, and alwaysApply: false and filename ends with -auto.mdc.
      - Always Rule: Global Rule applies to every chat and cmd/ctrl-k - description and globs blank, and alwaysApply: true  and filename ends with -always.mdc.
      - Agent Select Rule: The rule does not need to be loaded into every chat thread, it serves a specific purpose. The agent can see the descriptions, and choose to load the full rule in to context on its own - description is critical, globs blank, and alwaysApply:false and filename ends with -agent.mdc
  - For the Rule Context and Bullets - do not repeat yourself and do not be overly explanatory
  - When a rule will only be used sometimes (useAlways: false) it is CRITICAL that the description describes when the AI will load the full rule into its context
  - Use Concise Markdown Tailored to Agent Context Window usage
  - Always indent content within XML Example section with 2 spaces
  - Emojis and Mermaid diagrams are allowed and encouraged if it is not redundant and better explains the rule for the AI comprehension.
  - TRY to keep the total rule line count under 50 lines, better under 25 lines
  - Always include a valid and invalid example
  - NEVER use quotes around glob patterns, NEVER group glob extensions with `{}`
  - If the request for a rule or a future behavior change includes context of a mistake is made, this would be great to use in the example for the rule
  - After rule is created or updated, Respond with the following:
    - AutoRuleGen Success: path/rule-name.mdc
    - Rule Type: {Rule Type}
    - Short summary of what the rule will do
