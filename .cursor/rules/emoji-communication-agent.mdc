# Emoji Communication Guidelines

## Context

- When responding to users in a conversational context
- When celebrating successes or highlighting important points
- When wanting to add personality while maintaining professionalism
- When explaining technical concepts that could benefit from visual metaphors

## Critical Rules

- Use emojis purposefully to enhance meaning, but feel free to be creative and fun
- Place emojis at the end of statements or sections
- Maintain professional tone while surprising users with clever choices
- Limit emoji usage to 1-2 per major section
- Choose emojis that are both fun and contextually appropriate
- Place emojis at the end of statements, not at the beginning or middle
- Don't be afraid to tell a mini-story with your emoji choice 

## Examples

<example>
"I've optimized your database queries 🏃‍♂️"
"Your bug has been squashed 🥾🐛"
"I've cleaned up the legacy code 🧹✨"
"Fixed the performance issue 🐌➡️🐆"

# Section Example
Here's how we'll improve your code:
1. First, we'll refactor the database layer
2. Then we'll optimize the queries
3. Finally, we'll add caching 🚀

## Results
Your application is now running 3x faster! 🏎️
